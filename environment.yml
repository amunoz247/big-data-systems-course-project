#   Containerized Amazon Recommender System (CARS) Project:
#
#   Authors: Brianna Blain-Castelli, Nikkolas Irwin, Adam Cassell, and Andrew Munoz
#   Date: 04/01/2020
#   Purpose: Build a Big Data application using a Conda environment and Docker.
#   Course: CS 636 Big Data Systems
#   Project: CARS is an application that builds a recommender system from datasets provided by
#            UCSD (see citation below). 
#
#   Dataset URL: https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html
#
#   ***IMPORTANT*** You must download the dataset files for a particular category to your local machine yourself due
#                   to their size. As long as your dataset files are in the same directory as the Dockerfile, then
#                   they will be added to the volume and usable by the container as expected.

#   Conda Environmental File: This file specifies our Conda environment for the Docker container.
#
#   Top-Level Keys Explained:
#     1. name - Specifies the name of the Conda environment we will use for the containerized application. For our
#               purposes, it it set to base, which is the default environment that is supplied when installing Conda.
#
#     2. channels - Specifies the locations where packages are stored that we will install dependencies from.
#
#     3. dependencies - Specifies the explicit dependencies that must be installed when the conda environment is 
#                       created for our application.
#
#     4. prefix - Specifies the target directory for creating the environment (for our purposes this is in the
#                 container, but it could also be on the local file system.).
